<hr />

The goal of the task is to code a section describing the areas that a company specializing in AI researches. The section includes a brief description of AI-based systems and four areas in which the startup being reviewed specializes. All tiles have the same layout, so the final result should be one codebase with the appropriate modifiers.
To complete the task, use the starter code asset package and use the SCSS preprocessor for styling.

In the final result, the project should meet the following assumptions:
 - Tiles should be able to accept any length of text in the description
 - If one of the boxes in the row has longer text than the others, on the desktop version, all tiles in that row should be height-aligned to the longest one. For the mobile version, each tile should have a height consistent with the length of the text
 - The page should be properly displayed on any type of device (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)
 - The page should have properly handled interactive elements, such as links or buttons (the user should feel that something is happening when interacting with the element)
