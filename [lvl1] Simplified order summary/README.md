The aim of the task is to code an element that serves as an order summary. Proper implementation of this type of component is crucial for achieving a good conversion rate in online stores, so make every effort to ensure that the result of your work accurately reflects the design and is user-friendly.

To complete the task, use the starter code provided in the asset package. Utilize SCSS preprocessor and 'clean' JavaScript (Vanilla JS).

In the final result, the project should meet the following assumptions:
- All links should be clickable, but should not redirect anywhere. It is a good practice to use <a href = "#"></a>
- Clicking the "Proceed to payment" button should change its state to "loading". Use materials found on the Internet for the loader's appearance
- The page should be properly displayed on all types of devices (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)
- The page should have appropriately handled interactive elements, such as links or buttons (the user should feel that something is happening when hovering over an interactive element)
