<hr />

The task is to code a view of a card on which the details of an NFT available for purchase with ETH are displayed. To complete the task, use the starter code provided in the asset package. Use SCSS preprocessor for styling.

In the final result, the project should meet the following assumptions:
- The tile should be able to accommodate any length of text both in the title and in the description
- If the title is longer than 3 lines, it should be automatically truncated with an ellipsis at the end (...). The desired effect should be achieved without using JavaScript
- The card should adjust its height according to the length of the description
- The page should be properly displayed on all types of devices (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)
- The page should have appropriately handled interactive elements, such as links or buttons (the user should feel that something is happening when hovering over an interactive element)
