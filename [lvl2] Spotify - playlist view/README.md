<hr />

The goal of this task is to code the view of a playlist containing the biggest hits from around the world on the Spotify platform, which is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world, providing users with access to millions of music tracks from all over the world. Use the starter code provided in the asset package and utilize the SCSS preprocessor and "pure" JavaScript (VanillaJS).

In the end, the project should meet the following requirements:
- All links should be clickable, but not redirect to any other page. A good practice is to use <a href="#"</a> or router links leading to #
- All interactive elements with the songs and the entire playlist (liking, playing, etc.) should be clickable and interactive, but not trigger any additional actions
- The top menu containing arrows and login/register buttons should be sticky at the top of the screen (position: sticky)
- The arrows in the top menu are used to navigate between different subpages. In this project, they will not perform any function, so hovering over the arrow should change the cursor type to not-allowed
- The list of songs included in the playlist is unlimited. This means that the entire content should be scrollable
- The application should be properly displayed on every type of device (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)
- The application should have properly handled interactive elements such as links or buttons (the user should feel that something is happening when hovering over an interactive element)
