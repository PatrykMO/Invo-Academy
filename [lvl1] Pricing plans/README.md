<hr />

The aim of the task is to code a 3-column layout of tiles on the pricing plans page. To complete the task, use the starter code provided in the asset package, and utilize SCSS preprocessor for styling.
In the final result, the page should:
 - Have all links clickable, but should not redirect anywhere. It is a good practice to use <a href = "#"></a>
 - Be properly displayed on all types of devices (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)
 - Have appropriately handled interactive elements, such as links or buttons (the user should feel that something is happening when hovering over an interactive element)
